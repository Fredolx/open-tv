    Open TV is in crucial need of your help. Consider donating any amount (even 1$, it makes a big
    difference!) to support future development.

    1.8.X is the Fan Edition! It combines all the most hotly requested features from all of you and
    bunch of crucial bugfixes. I always made Open TV mostly to my own taste, but this changes today
    as this update celebrates your support by implementing every single popular feature request. I
    hope you'll enjoy it.

    On a seperate note, Open TV Mobile has finally launched! It's a bit of an early release so
    expect a few bugs. Every purchase directly contributes to the development.
